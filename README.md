# Analysis of travel times to hospitals and health centers in Ethiopia
## A country-wide analysis to plan COVID-19 response

## Donwload OSM data

Larger OSM datasets can be downloaded from Geofabrik [here](https://download.geofabrik.de/)
Select the .osm.pbf file of the country you want to study. 

## Prepare  OSRM
Once the OSM data has downloaded, navigate to the ./data folder where the .osm.pbf file is located and set up OSRM:

    docker run -t -dv "$PWD:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-extract -p /opt/car.lua /data/ethiopia-latest.osm.pbf
    docker run -t -v "$PWD:/data" osrm/osrm-backend osrm-contract /data/ethiopia-latest.osm.pbf
    docker run -t -i -p 5000:5000 -v $PWD:/data osrm/osrm-backend osrm-routed --algorithm ch /data/ethiopia-latest.osrm
    docker run -p 9966:9966 osrm/osrm-frontend
    open 'http://127.0.0.1:9966'

## Facebook HRSL data
The 30m population high-resolution settlement layer for Ethiopia (in .geotiff format) can be downloaded [here](https://data.humdata.org/organization/facebook?q=ethiopia&ext_page_size=25).

## Hospital data
The dataset for the hospital dataset can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-019-0142-2).
The files which were used in in this demonstration are saved in this repo under /data/ethiopia/raw. We divided the dataset
into one with all the hospitals and one with health centers.

**Important:** Some of the locations in the HRSL and hopsital data were not covered by the OSM data downloaded from the link above.
This can lead to errors from OSRM when queried. As such, the entries outside our OSM data were removed from the hospital and healthcare center dataset.
